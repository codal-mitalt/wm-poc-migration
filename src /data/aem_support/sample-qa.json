Customer agrees that the Waste Materials collected under these terms and conditions shall not include any Excluded Materials. &quot;Waste Materials&quot; means all non-hazardous solid waste, organic waste, and if applicable, recyclables, generated by Customer or at Customer's service address. Waste Materials shall not include any Excluded Materials. &quot;Excluded Materials&quot; means (a) any waste tires, (b) radioactive, volatile, corrosive, flammable, explosive, biomedical, infectious, bio-hazardous, toxic, regulated medical or hazardous waste, substance or material, as defined by, characterized or listed under applicable federal, state, or local laws or regulations; (c) any materials containing information protected by federal, state or local privacy and security laws or regulations; (d) any materials that, due to its physical or chemical characteristics, requires more stringent environmental protection, handling, documentation or other management than normal municipal solid waste; and (e) any other waste or material that is prohibited from being received, managed or disposed of at the disposal facility. Title to and liability for Excluded Materials shall remain with Customer at all times. Title to Customer's Waste Materials is transferred to WM upon WM's receipt or collection unless otherwise provided in these terms and conditions or applicable law.<br>\n<\/p>\n<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>EQUIPMENT.&nbsp;<\/b>Any cart(s) or bin(s) (&quot;Equipment&quot;) WM furnishes to Customer shall remain WM's property. While the Equipment is in Customer's possession, Customer is liable for all loss or damage to the Equipment, except for normal wear and tear. Customer shall provide safe, unobstructed access to the Equipment on the collection day. If applicable, Customer must place the Equipment curbside by 7:00 a.m. on the collection day.<\/p>\n<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>INVOICES; PAYMENT TERMS. (a)<\/b>&nbsp;Customer will be billed in advance by WM on a periodic basis (e.g., monthly, quarterly, annually). The invoices represent WM's offer to provide such Services for the specified billing period. By accepting Service, Customer agrees to these Terms and Conditions and to continue the Service for the billing period. Invoices may also include past due balances, or Charges for additional services requested or incurred by Customer during a previous billing period. An Equipment delivery fee may apply at the start of service, and an Equipment removal charge will apply upon cancellation of service. See section 4 below for further information on additional charges.<\/p>\n<p><b>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/b>&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;Emailed Invoices and Convenience Fee for Digital Payments.<\/b> For Customers that have enrolled in paperless billing and receive their periodic invoices by electronic mail, Customer agrees that periodic invoices can be emailed to Customer at any time of day, including during non-business hours. Customer agrees to pay WM the invoiced amount (&quot;Charges&quot;) within thirty (30) days of the date of the invoice. Invoices can be paid online at <a href=\"/myaccount.html\">wm.com/myaccount<\/a>. The customary means of online payments is through automatic withdrawal from a bank account (sometimes referred to as an Automated Clearing House (\u201cACH\u201d) transaction in the U.S. or a Pre-Authorized Debit (\u201cPAD\u201d) in Canada). No fee will be charged for online payments, or automatic payments, made by automatic withdrawal (ACH/PAD) from a bank account. If Customer chooses an alternative means of making a payment, the online payment system provider, Paymentus, may charge a fee (\u201cConvenience Fee\u201d) for processing the payment. Payments made electronically by credit or debit card, or by digital wallet methods such as Venmo, Apple Pay and Google Wallet, may be charged a Convenience Fee by Paymentus. For customers newly enrolling in AutoPay, if Customer elects to make each automatic payment by credit or debit card or by digital wallet methods such as Venmo, Apple Pay or Google Wallet, Paymentus may apply the Convenience Fee to each automatic payment. If a Convenience Fee is charged, it will be disclosed prior to Customer making a payment and Customer will be given the option of not proceeding with the payment transaction if Customer does not wish to pay the Convenience Fee. Customers that enrolled in automatic payment before August 2024 when Paymentus, the online payment system provider, introduced the Convenience Fee will be given the opportunity to choose the customary payment method, an alternative method that is charged the Convenience Fee, or unenroll in automatic payment. If a Convenience Fee is assessed, then Paymentus will only process the payment if Customer agrees to pay the Convenience Fee. The Convenience Fee will be a flat $1.99 charge per payment for residential service customers in the United States, and $2.75 CAD for residential service customers in Canada, and the Convenience Fee amount may be changed from time to time at the payment system provider\u2019s discretion. Customer agrees that the Convenience Fee is a fee for the use of alternative payment channels through the use of the Paymentus service and is not a surcharge imposed for making a credit or debit card payment. By contract or because of state or provincial law restrictions, some customers may pay a non-standard convenience fee or be exempt from paying any convenience fee.<\/p>\n<p><b>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/b>&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;Late Fees and Suspension or Termination of Services for Nonpayment.<\/b> If full payment of the Charges is not received by WM within thirty (30) days from the date of the invoice, Customer may be assessed a late fee as specified on the invoice, which shall be for the maximum monthly late charge allowed under applicable law on all past due amounts accruing from the date of the invoice, with a minimum monthly late fee of five dollars ($5.00). Customer acknowledges that such late fee is not to be considered as interest or debt on a finance charge, but rather is a reasonable charge for the anticipated loss and cost to WM for the late payment. Additionally, if Customer fails to timely pay an invoice, WM may terminate or suspend services until full payment is received. If Customer\u2019s service is suspended for non-payment, Customer may be charged a resume fee to restart service. If Services are suspended or terminated by WM due to Customer's breach of these terms or if Customer terminates the Services, Customer understands and agrees that WM will not refund, or pro-rate or return any amounts previously paid by Customer to WM in advance for monthly or quarterly pre-paid services, unless such refund is required by law or regulation. Annual prepaid services that are cancelled by Customer prior to the end of the annual term will be refunded for the amount of unused days left in the annual term.<\/p>\n<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>ADDITIONAL SERVICE CHARGES, INCLUDING CART OVERAGE AND RECYCLING CONTAMINATION CHARGES.<\/b>&nbsp;In addition to the Charges, WM also reserves the right to charge Customer for additional services provided by WM to Customer, whether requested or incurred by Customer, including, but not limited to, account resume or reactivation services; extra pickups or trip charges; a charge for recyclable contamination included in Customer\u2019s cart(s) as described below; and a charge for container overages and overflows as described below (see www.wm.com/billhelp for a list of \u201cextra charges on my invoice\u201d , which may be updated from time to time), all at such standard prices or rates that WM is charging its customers in the service area at such time.&nbsp;Customers are advised to request the current charge amounts for any additional services at the time of ordering, and to call the number listed on their invoice for further details on any Charges.\u202f An Energy Surcharge applies to all other Charges, including cart delivery and/or removal charges, whether or not listed in these terms, and information about the Energy Surcharge can be found at www.wm.com/billhelp. State &amp; Local taxes, and/or fees and a Recycle Material Offset, if applicable, will also be added to the Charges. An Administrative Charge per invoice will be assessed and can be removed by enrolling in paperless statements and automated payments, unless prohibited by law.<\/p>\n<p><b>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Overage Charge and How It Can Be Avoided<\/b>. Generating more waste than expected can&nbsp;cause an overage and an overage charge of five dollars ($5.00) per overloaded container per incident. Overloaded containers pose safety risks for our drivers and create unsightly messes in your community. An overage is whenever WM documents one of these customer situations:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Overloaded container&nbsp;(e.g., container lids not securely closed)<\/li>\n<li>Lids left closed with debris stacked on top of the&nbsp;lids or outside of the container<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Customers can avoid overage charges by making sure their waste or recycling materials fit within their carts with the lids closed. If Customers find they need additional cart space for their materials, they should contact WM to discuss service options, including the possibility of increasing their pick-up frequency, adding larger or additional carts to their account, or both.<\/p>\n<p><b>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/b>&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;The Recycling Contamination Charge and How It Can Be Avoided<\/b>. Recycling contamination happens when trash ruins otherwise good recyclables, causing a contamination charge of five dollars ($5.00) per contaminated recycling container per incident. Once contaminated, these recyclables can no longer be recycled and they become trash, or the costs increase to process the recyclables and remove the contamination.&nbsp;For recyclable materials to have a second life, they must be clean and free from contaminants. Remember these three simple rules to recycle right:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Recycle clean bottles, cans, paper &amp; cardboard.<\/li>\n<li>Keep food and liquid out of your recycling.<\/li>\n<li>No loose plastic bags &amp; no bagged recyclables.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For more information, visit&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wm.com/us/en/recycle-right\" title=\"https://www.wm.com/us/en/recycle-right\">wm.com/recycleright<\/a>&nbsp;for tips and educational tools to recycle right.<\/p>\n<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>CHARGE INCREASES.<\/b> WM may increase the price for subscription residential collection services from billing period to billing period, and Customers may terminate or choose to not renew services after each billing period without penalty. WM also may increase the Charges on an annual basis to account for increases in the US Consumer Price Index (&quot;CPI&quot;) for Water, Sewer and Trash Collection Services published by U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, or with written notice to Customer, any other national, regional or local CPI. WM may also adjust the Charges to cover any increases in disposal, processing and/or transportation costs and to cover increased costs due to uncontrollable circumstances, including, without limitation, changes in local, state or federal laws or regulations, imposition of taxes, fees or surcharges or acts of God such as floods, fires, hurricanes and natural disasters. Changes in the frequency of collection, collection schedule, number, capacity and/or type of Equipment, and any changes to the Charges payable under these terms may be agreed to orally, in writing, by payment of the invoice reflecting such changes, or by the actions and practices of the parties.<\/p>\n<p>6.<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; HOW TO TERMINATE RESIDENTIAL SERVICES AND ARRANGE FOR THE REMOVAL OF WM\u2019S CARTS.<\/b> Once WM has commenced providing collection services to your residence, to terminate services, either during or at the end of a billing period, please contact WM by telephone at <a href=\"tel:866-964-2729\">866-964-2729<\/a><b> <\/b>and allow WM\u2019s interactive voice response agent to help you terminate services and arrange for the removal of your trash and/or recycling carts.

Prior to bringing a lawsuit or initiating an arbitration that asserts a claim arising out of or related to the Services (as further defined below, \u201cClaim\u201d), the party asserting the Claim (\u201cClaimant\u201d) shall give the other party (\u201cRespondent\u201d) written notice of the Claim (\u201cClaim Notice\u201d) and a reasonable opportunity, not less than 30 days, to resolve the Claim through good faith efforts of both parties. Any Claim Notice to Customer shall be sent to the address we have in our records (or any updated address Customer subsequently provides to us). Any Claim Notice to us shall be sent to: <a href=\"mailto:prearbnotice@wm.com\">prearbnotice@wm.com<\/a>. Any Claim Notice Customer sends must provide Customer\u2019s name, address and Account number and explain the nature of the Claim and relief demanded. Customer may only submit a Claim Notice on Customer\u2019s own behalf and not on behalf of any other party. No third party, other than a lawyer Customer has personally retained, may submit a Claim Notice on Customer\u2019s behalf. The Claimant must reasonably cooperate in providing any information about the Claim that the Respondent reasonably requests. Any statute of limitations applicable to the Claim described in the Claim Notice shall be tolled during the period between the date that the Claim Notice is sent and the later of;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. 60 days after receipt of the Claim Notice, or<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. 30 days after either Claimant or Respondent informs the other that good faith efforts to resolve the Claim informally have ceased.<\/p>\n<p>A lawsuit or arbitration proceeding may not be commenced unless the Claimant has complied with the procedure in this paragraph. A court will have authority to enforce this notice procedure, including the power to enjoin the filing or prosecution of arbitrations without first complying with this provision. Unless prohibited by applicable law, the arbitration Administrator is without authority to accept or administer any arbitration proceeding unless the Claimant has complied with this notice procedure.<\/p>\n<p>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b><u>Jury Trial Waiver<\/u><\/b>. <b>To the extent permitted by law, Customer and WM waive any right to trial by jury in the event of a lawsuit involving any Claim (defined below) asserted against each other, including but not limited to those arising out of or related to the Services. This jury trial waiver shall not affect the Arbitration Provision below (including the jury trial waiver contained therein). Customer and WM each represent that this waiver is given knowingly, willingly and voluntarily.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><u>Parties<\/u><\/b>. Solely as used in this Arbitration Provision, the terms \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cus\u201d and \u201cour\u201d mean:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a. WM and its successors and/or assigns, as well as any parent, subsidiary, affiliate of theirs and their employees, officers and directors (the \u201cWM Parties\u201d);and,<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b. any other person or company that provides any services in connection with the Services if Customer asserts a Claim against such other person or company at the same time Customer asserts a Claim against any WM Party.<\/p>\n<p>E.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><u>Agreement to Binding Arbitration<\/u><\/b>. <b>Review this provision carefully. If Customer does not reject it in accordance with Section 10(I), below, it will be part of Customer\u2019s agreement with WM and will have a substantial impact on the way Customer and WM resolve any Claim we have against each other, now or in the future.<\/b><\/p>\n<p>If the parties do not reach an agreed upon resolution pursuant to the process outlined in Section 10(B), above, all the parties agree that any and all Claims will be resolved via binding arbitration, as set forth herein. \u201cClaim\u201d means any claim, dispute or controversy between Customer and the WM Parties, including but not limited to, those that in any way arise from or relate to these Terms and Conditions (including their formation, performance and breach), the parties' relationship with each other, marketing efforts related to the Services, communications from WM, WM's provision of the Services or any alleged failure to provide Services, the Charges or other amounts assessed by WM including but not limited to for the provision of Services, the mode of payment selected by Customer, Convenience Fees charged as part of the Customer\u2019s payment of any invoice, prior agreements between Customer and WM, and/or WM\u2019s handling or dissemination of personally identifying information or any other consumer data or information. \u201cClaim\u201d includes disputes arising from actions or omissions prior to the date Customer agreed to these Terms and Conditions, including the advertising and marketing related to, application for or initiation of the Services. &quot;Claim&quot; has the broadest possible meaning, and includes initial claims, counterclaims, cross-claims and third-party claims. It includes disputes based on contract, tort, consumer rights, fraud and other intentional torts, constitution, statute, regulation, ordinance, common law and equity (including any claim for individual injunctive or declaratory relief). &quot;Claim&quot; includes disputes about the validity, enforceability, coverage or scope of this Arbitration Provision; however, any dispute regarding the class action waiver or class arbitration waiver contained in Section 10(H) are for a court and not an arbitrator to decide. Any dispute or argument that concerns the validity or enforceability of the Terms and Conditions as a whole is for the arbitrator, not a court, to decide.<\/p>\n<p>If Customer or WM elect to arbitrate a Claim, Customer will not have the right to pursue that Claim in court or have a jury decide the Claim. Also, your ability to obtain information from us is more limited in arbitration than in a lawsuit. Other rights that Customer would have if Customer went to court may also not be available in arbitration.<\/p>\n<p>The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.<\/p>\n<p>The arbitrator may also allocate compensation, expenses and administrative fees (which include filing and hearing fees) to any party upon the arbitrator\u2019s determination that the party\u2019s claim or counterclaim was filed for purposes of harassment or is patently frivolous.<\/p>\n<p>Judgment upon the arbitrator\u2019s award may be entered by any court having jurisdiction. The arbitrator\u2019s decision is final and binding, except for any right of appeal provided by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16 (&quot;FAA&quot;) and/or the rules of the Administrator.&nbsp; Any finding, award or judgment from an arbitration of any Claim shall apply only to that arbitration. No finding, award or judgment from any other arbitration shall impact the arbitration of any claim.<\/p>\n<p>F.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><u>Starting an Arbitration<\/u><\/b>. Arbitration may be elected by any party with respect to any Claim, even if that party has already initiated a lawsuit with respect to a different Claim. Arbitration is started by giving a written demand for arbitration to the other party and filing the arbitration demand with the Administrator, pursuant to the Administrator\u2019s procedures. Customer and WM will not choose to arbitrate any individual Claim against each other brought in small claims court or Customer\u2019s or WM\u2019s state\u2019s equivalent court. This means Customer and WM may bring an action in small claims court without being subject to arbitration. However, if a Claim is transferred, removed or appealed from small claims court to a different court, or if any Claim brought in small claims court exceeds the small claims court limit or attempts to change an individual Claim into a class or other representative Claim, Customer or WM will then have the right to demand arbitration.<\/p>\n<p>G.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><u>Administrator<\/u><\/b>. &quot;Administrator&quot; means the American Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;), 120 Broadway, 21st Floor, New York, NY 10271. The AAA\u2019s rules governing the arbitration will be the Consumer Arbitration Rules, available at <a href=\"https://www.adr.org\" target=\"_blank\">www.adr.org<\/a>. The arbitrator will be appointed by the Administrator in accordance with the rules of the Administrator. However, the arbitrator must be a retired or former judge or a lawyer with at least 10 years of experience. If the AAA refuses to administer the arbitration and the parties are unable to select a substitute administrator, the Administrator will be selected by a court with jurisdiction pursuant to Section 5 of the FAA. Notwithstanding any language in this Arbitration Provision to the contrary, no arbitration may be administered by any Administrator (including the AAA) that has in place a formal or informal policy that is inconsistent with the Class Action Waiver, without the consent of all parties to the arbitration.<\/p>\n<p>Each party will have the right to use legal counsel in connection with arbitration at its own expense. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator's award shall be in writing and provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions, shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The interpretation and enforcement of these Terms and Conditions shall be subject to the FAA.<\/p>\n<p>If Customer initiates arbitration, to the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds Two Hundred and Fifty U.S. Dollars ($250.00), WM will pay the additional cost. If WM is required to pay the additional cost of the filing fees, Customer should submit a request for payment of fees to the AAA along with Customer's form for initiating the arbitration, and WM will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA. WM will also be responsible for paying all other arbitration costs arising in connection with the arbitration.&nbsp; Customer will not be required to pay fees and costs incurred by WM if Customer does not prevail in arbitration.<\/p>\n<p>H.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><u>Class Action and Class Arbitration Waiver<\/u><\/b>. Customer and WM each further agree that:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>any arbitration shall be conducted in their respective individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action;<\/li>\n<li>each expressly waive their rights to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis;<\/li>\n<li>neither Customer nor WM may act as a private attorney general in court or in arbitration;<\/li>\n<li>absent the written consent of all parties, Claims brought by or against Customer may not be joined or consolidated with Claims brought by or against any other person; and,<\/li>\n<li>the arbitrator shall have no power or authority to conduct a class-wide arbitration, private attorney general arbitration or other representative arbitration.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above in Section 10(E) shall be deemed null and&nbsp;void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.<\/p>\n<p><a><\/a>I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><u>30 Day Right to Opt Out<\/u><\/b>. Customer has the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth in Section 10 by sending written notice of Customer's decision to opt-out to the following email:&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:arbitrationoptout@wm.com\">arbitrationoptout@wm.com<\/a>. The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of enrolling for the Services, otherwise Customer will be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those sections. The opt-out notice must include your name, address, phone number and Account number. If Customer opts out of these arbitration provisions, WM also will not be bound by them. Customer\u2019s rejection of the arbitration and class action waiver provisions will not affect any other provision of the Terms and Conditions or Customer\u2019s ability to obtain the Services.<\/p>\n<p>J.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><u>Governing Law<\/u><\/b>. This Arbitration Provision is governed by the FAA and not by any state arbitration law. The arbitrator must apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations and claims of privilege recognized at law. The arbitrator may award any remedy provided by the substantive law that would apply in an individual case if the action were pending in court (including, without limitation, punitive damages, which shall be governed by the Constitutional standards employed by the courts). The substantive law applicable to any Claim will be the law of the state where the Services are provided.<\/p>\n<p>K.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b><u>Exclusive Venue for Litigation<\/u><\/b>.&nbsp;To the extent that the arbitration provisions set forth in Section 10(E) do not apply, the parties agree that any litigation between them shall be filed exclusively in state or federal courts located&nbsp;in Houston, Texas (except for small claims court actions which may be brought in the county where Customer resides). The parties expressly consent to exclusive jurisdiction in Houston, Texas for any applicable litigation other than small claims court actions.<\/p>\n<p><b>APPLICABLE LAW MAY PROVIDE CUSTOMER THE RIGHT TO CANCEL THIS TRANSACTION, IF CUSTOMER SO DESIRES, WITHOUT ANY PENALTY OR OBLIGATION AT ANY TIME WITHIN THREE BUSINESS DAYS (EXCLUDING SATURDAYS, SUNDAYS AND LEGAL HOLIDAYS) OF ACCEPTANCE OF THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

The Energy Surcharge is a recurring charge and typically is a fluctuating percentage of all invoice charges, excluding taxes. The Energy Surcharge fluctuates up or down based upon on changes in the reported prices of diesel fuel and/or natural gas (a component of compressed natural gas or \u201cCNG\u201d), as reported the U.S. Department of Energy in its weekly diesel price index and Henry Hub spot price index for natural gas. For Canadian customers, the Canadian national diesel price index is published by Bloomberg. The Energy Surcharge is intended to measure the changes in the cost of diesel, natural gas, and other hydrocarbon-based fuels and products that our WM operating companies and subcontractors use in our overall enterprise.

This charge fluctuates with the nationally published price of diesel and is intended to measure the changes in the cost of diesel, natural gas, and other hydrocarbon-based fuels and products that our WM operating companies use in our overall enterprise. The Environmental Charge is a recurring charge and is typically a fixed percentage (currently 20%, subject to change) of all invoice charges including all ancillary charges, including the Fuel Surcharge, but excluding the Regulatory Cost Recovery Charge and taxes. The Environmental Charge is intended to cover Waste Management's enterprise-wide environmentally-related costs for its WM operating companies to operate in a safe and environmentally responsible manner, plus an acceptable operating margin. Such enterprise-wide environmental costs include, without limitation, landfill cover material, engineering, testing and maintenance of landfills or other disposal facilities, the disposal of tires, batteries, oils and fluids and the monitoring and management of vehicle emissions. <b><a>Learn more about the <\/a>Fuel/Environmental Charge&nbsp;for&nbsp;<a title=\"Fuel/Environmental Charge for US customers\" href=\"/us/en/terms/charge-information.html\" target=\"_blank\">customers in the US<\/a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title=\"Fuel/Environmental Charge for Canadian customers\" href=\"/ca/en/terms/charge-information.html\" target=\"_blank\">customers in Canada<\/a>.<\/b><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr><tr><td width=\"312\"><p><b>Regulatory Cost Recovery<\/b> <b>Charge<\/b><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<td width=\"312\"><p>For most WM customers, starting in April 2023 WM absorbed its Environmental Charge and Regulatory Cost Recovery Charge into each customer\u2019s base service rate so those charges will no longer appear separately on most bills.

The RMO is usually a charge but could be a credit to the customer\u2019s bill and is calculated based on the amount that (a) our applicable WM operating company processing cost per ton, including costs of disposal for contamination and profit margin, exceeds (b) an amount equal to the blended value per ton of processed recyclables, minus an amount for profit margin. The RMO, including profit margin, processing and disposal costs, and recyclables blended value shall be determined by WM from time-to-time, in its sole discretion, based on applicable operating data and market information. In October 2023, WM refined the RMO calculation for customers in the US by incorporating objective index values for blended commodity prices which increased the charge modestly&nbsp;<b><u>at that time<\/u><\/b>&nbsp;but allows the value of the charge to&nbsp;<b><u>increase or decrease<\/u><\/b>&nbsp;over time in a manner more reflective of changes in the market price of recyclable commodities as reflected by those indices.

Typically, service start dates fall outside standard invoicing or billing periods. When this occurs, customers receive service charges adjusted (or prorated) for the month or billing period when services start. Generally, most customers are billed in advance for service. Therefore, the customer's first invoice will contain prorated service charges and advanced billing. For example, if a customer requests services to start on the 20th of June, the customer's first invoice will show 10 days of prorated services for June as well as the full monthly charges for July. Some residential customers are invoiced on a quarterly or other longer billing cycle. These customers would receive a prorated charge for the current billing period, as well as advance charges for the subsequent quarterly or another billing period.<\/p>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr><tr><td width=\"312\"><p><b>Taxes<\/b><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<td width=\"312\"><p>Taxes may apply to charges for products and services included in your invoice. Specific taxes vary by state/province and locality.<\/p>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr><tr><td width=\"312\"><p><b>Waste Water<\/b><br>\n<b>Management Charge<\/b><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<td width=\"312\"><p>The Waste Water Management (WWM) charge applies to disposal customers only. The WWM charge is a fixed percentage (currently 18.9%, subject to change) of applicable disposal and invoice charges, before taxes. This charge allows us to cover Waste Management's enterprise-wide costs associated with collecting, treating, disposing and managing the wastewater generated by our landfills and other post-collection operations in accordance with applicable law and a safe and environmentally responsible manner, and for us to achieve an acceptable operating margin. Wastewater is generated when any form of liquid, including water, passes through waste materials.&nbsp; As such, wastewater generation is a concern for most landfills and disposal facilities and requires specific collection, treatment, and disposal.<\/p>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr><tr><td width=\"312\"><p><b>Additional Services and Other Invoice<\/b><br>\n<b>Charges<\/b><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<td width=\"312\"><p>For roll-off service, there are monthly minimum haul or inactivity charges and minimum tonnage charges that apply. Other additional charges also may be incurred for additional services and other reasons including but not limited to the following: container overages or overfilling; contamination or non-conforming waste; demurrage; dig out service; late payment; a returned check for non-sufficient funds; delivery, moving or removing a container; resumed/restart services for previously suspended/terminated for non-payment; and extra trips. The amount of these charges vary by service area and may change from time to time, as set by a WM operating company for its customers.&nbsp; Customers are advised to request the current charge amount for any additional service at the time of ordering or customer initiation.&nbsp; For more information on these charges, call the number listed on your invoice to speak with a local service representative.<\/p>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr><tr><td width=\"312\"><p><b>Cameras To Help With Operational Efficiency<\/b><\/p>\n<\/td>\n<td width=\"312\"><p>As part of our operational efficiency and providing you better service and safety, cameras and other devices such as the WM Smart Truck<sup>SM<\/sup> system may be enabled on trucks and dumpsters to capture images (still and/or video) of dumpsters, waste and recycling materials and events related to your service. This also helps ensure compliance with contract terms including, but not limited to, charges related to overloaded and damaged containers and contamination based on information from such images.<\/p>\n<\/td>\n<\/tr><\/tbody><\/table>\n",

Notifications for rate increases are typically provided the month of, or the month prior to, the increase and can be found in the &quot;<i>Important Messages<\/i>&quot; section on a customer's invoice.<\/p>\n<p>Increases to service rates may be based on several factors, including to cover increases to both internal and third-party disposal, processing and/or transportation costs, increased costs due to uncontrollable circumstances, including, without limitation, changes in local, state or federal laws or regulations, imposition of taxes, fees or surcharges or acts of God such as floods, fires, pandemics, hurricanes and natural disasters, and increases in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) as published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Standard CPI rate increases for US customers are tied to increases in the Water, Sewer, and Trash Collection Services expenditure category of CPI-U (non-seasonally adjusted, rolling 12-month average) published by the BLS (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/cpi/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"https://www.bls.gov/cpi/\">www.bls.gov/cpi/<\/a>&nbsp;for more information). We may also apply different CPI-based price increases, including a contractually allowed CPI+4% price increase for certain customers, or seek price increases for other reasons and/or for our WM operating companies to achieve acceptable operating margins.<\/p>\n<p><b>Franchise/Municipal Customers<br>\n <\/b>Residential, commercial and roll-off container customers serviced pursuant to a franchise agreement with a municipality or local governmental authority are subject to price increases permitted under the terms of such agreements.<\/p>\n<p><b>Open Market/Subscription Residential Customers<br>\n <\/b>Generally, open market residential subscription collection customers are serviced on a prepaid quarter by quarter (or other periodic) basis, without individual service agreements. Therefore, our WM operating companies can increase the price or cost to provide such residential collection service from billing period to billing period, and customers may terminate or choose to not renew services after each billing period. Residential subscription customers are billed in advance and invoices represent the WM operating company's offer to provide or continue to provide such services for the specified billing period. &nbsp;By paying the invoice and not canceling service, the customer is agreeing to continue the service for the billing period and there is no proration or partial refund for any cancellation prior to the end of the billing period.<\/p>\n<p><b>Non-franchise Commercial/Roll-off<br>\n <\/b>WM operating companies provide non-franchise commercial small containers and permanent (i.e., recurring service) roll-off container service to customers under fixed-term contracts with renewal options. Under Section 4(b) of our current standard service agreement terms and conditions for a commercial small container and roll-off customers (&quot;standard commercial/roll-off service agreement&quot;), your applicable WM operating company has the right to increase a customer's service rate and charges for any one or more of the following reasons:<\/p>\n<p>(i) for any changes to, or differences between, the actual equipment and services provided by such WM operating company to the customer and those specified in the Service Summary to the customer's service agreement;<\/p>\n<p>(ii) for any change in the composition of the &quot;Waste Materials&quot; (as defined in the service agreement) or if the average weight per yard of the customer's Waste Materials exceeds the amount specified on the customer's Service Summary;<\/p>\n<p>(iii) &nbsp;for any increase in or other modification to our Energy Surcharge, Recyclable Material Offset, and/or any Fees/Charges included in the customer's Service Summary;<\/p>\n<p>(iv) for any increase in or other modification to our Fuel Surcharge, Environmental Charge or Regulatory Cost Recovery Charge, for those customers still paying these charges rather than the Energy Surcharge after April 2023;<\/p>\n<p>(v) to cover any increases in disposal, processing and/or transportation costs, including fuel surcharges;<\/p>\n<p>(vi) &nbsp;to cover increased costs due to uncontrollable circumstances, including, without limitation, changes in local, state or federal laws or regulations, the imposition of taxes, fees or surcharges or acts of God such as floods, fires, pandemics, hurricanes, and natural disasters&quot;; and/or<\/p>\n<p>(vii) &nbsp;for increases in any Consumer Price Index or components thereof applicable to the services (for U.S. customers, generally the Water, Sewer, and Trash Collection Services expenditure category of CPI-U published by the BLS.<\/p>\n<p>The price increases specified in (i) through (vi) above may be applied singularly or cumulatively and may include an amount for such a company's operating or profit margin. Price increases are not represented to be solely an offset or pass-through of the company's costs.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to specific price increases allowed under Section 4(b), WM operating companies also regularly seek price increases subject to customer consent pursuant to Section 4(c) of our standard commercial/roll-off service agreement. &nbsp;WM operating companies notify such customers of these price increases subject to customer consent, through invoice messaging, invoice inserts or separately mailed price increase notifications. Under Section 4(c) of such service agreement, the customer can either accept the price increase or trigger termination of its service agreement, without any obligation to pay liquidated damages. &nbsp;Under Section 4(a) of our standard commercial/roll-off service agreement, payment of the price increase is deemed to be a customer's consent to the consensual price increase.<\/p>\n<p>Pricing, price increases and the assessment of charges, whether pursuant to Section 4 of our standard commercial/roll-off service agreement or subject to other applicable service terms or customer consent, are not applied uniformly and vary from customer to customer. &nbsp;By contract or at the company's discretion, some customers are exempt from base rate or CPI-based price increases or do not pay Waste Management's standard or common charges, such as our Energy Surcharge, or Fuel and Environmental Charges. Which does not change the aggregate amount of the standard charges changed to all other customers.&nbsp;Section 4 price increases and charges are designed to recover all applicable costs as to all customers from only those customers subject to the price increase or charge, excluding any exempt or non-paying customers, and to achieve an acceptable operating margin.<\/p>\n<p><b>Check Your Applicable Service Terms<br>\n <\/b>The service terms referenced above may apply to you, or your service terms may be different. Not all collection customers have service agreements and not all commercial and roll-off customers are covered by our standard commercial/roll-off service agreement.

BINDING ARBITRATION:<\/b>&nbsp;Except for those claims expressly&nbsp;excluded below (EXCLUDED CLAIMS), Customer and Company agree that ANY and all existing or future controversy or claim between them arising out of or related to this Agreement or any other agreements between the parties, whether based in contract, law or equity or alleging any other legal theory, or arising prior to, in connection with, or after the termination of this Agreement or any prior agreements, shall be resolved by mandatory binding arbitration (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wm.com/\">www.wm.com<\/a>&nbsp;for details on arbitration procedures).<\/li>\n<li><b>CLASS ACTION WAIVER:<\/b>&nbsp;Customer and Company agree that under no circumstances, whether in arbitration or otherwise, may customer bring any claim against the Company, or allow any claim that the Customer may have against the Company to be asserted, as part of a class action, on a consolidated or representative basis or otherwise aggregated with claims brought by, or on behalf of, any other entity or person, including other customers of the Company.<\/li>\n<li><b>EXCLUDED CLAIMS:<\/b>&nbsp;The following are not subject to mandatory binding arbitration: (A) either party's claims against the other in connection with bodily injury or real property damage and for environmental indemnification; and (B) Company's claims against Customer for collection or payment of Charges, damages (liquidated or otherwise) or any other amounts due or payable to the Company by the Customer under this Agreement or any prior agreements between the parties, but Customer and Company may mutually agree to arbitrate any Excluded Claims.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>General Information<\/b><br>\nThe material below provides information and describes the details of the terms and conditions of the agreed upon arbitration process. Waste Management is committed to controlling costs so we can continue to provide you with the best overall value in waste related services. Litigation avoidance and/or streamlined dispute resolution through arbitration will assist&nbsp;in this regard. For this reason and others, including attempting to amicably resolve any disputes with you, our customer, we have incorporated into our Agreement the binding arbitration process set forth below. Before pursuing arbitration, Waste Management hopes that any issue of concern can be resolved through local management and/or your Sales representative on an informal basis. Waste Management also is willing to explore with you mediation, which is another alternative dispute resolution process in which a third person (a mediator) would aid us in jointly resolving our dispute. However, because no binding decision is rendered in mediation, we each must consider the pros and cons of this alternative process. Nothing said in mediation can later be used in the arbitration process, if the dispute is not resolved in mediation.<\/p>\n<p>If we are unable to resolve a matter to your satisfaction, we have agreed upon the binding arbitration process below to resolve any remaining dispute that is&nbsp;subject to arbitration under our Agreement. Arbitration is an alternative dispute resolution process where a neutral third party (an arbitrator) provides a fair hearing and decides a dispute. An arbitrator can make a decision based solely on documents submitted by the parties, can award the same relief as a court, and must honor the terms of our Agreement. Arbitration does not have a judge or a jury - it is an alternative to litigation in a court. Proceeding in arbitration may result in limited discovery and may be subject to limited review by courts. Arbitration is typically faster, and it is less formal than a courtroom proceeding. Counsel is not required, but using counsel is an option for each of us. Of course, this process could save time and money for both sides. If either party decides that it desires a hearing, including by telephone, the arbitrator would provide the same.<\/p>\n<p><b>How Does Either Party Begin Arbitration?<br>\n <\/b>The party seeking arbitration under this arbitration provision shall first provide written notice to the other party (at the address and as provided in our Agreement), which notice would include a short statement of the dispute, including the relief sought, and the notice would be served at least thirty (30) days prior to the initiation of arbitration. If we are unable to resolve the dispute within thirty (30) days after receipt of the notice, then either party may proceed to&nbsp;file an arbitration claim. The party initiating the arbitration proceeding would open a case with the American Arbitration Association - Case Filing Services, 1101 Laurel Oak Road, Suite 100, Voorhees, NJ 08043, 877-493-4185,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.adr.org/?_ga=2.11513079.214854769.1561495045-1858826525.1561495045\">http://www.adr.org/<\/a>&nbsp;under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA).<\/p>\n<p><b>Dispute Resolution and the Arbitration Process<\/b><br>\nThe parties will jointly appoint a single arbitrator who has at least ten (10) years' experience in the active practice of commercial contracts. The expense and the fees for the arbitrator will be shared equally by the parties. If the parties cannot agree on the appointment of a single arbitrator, it is agreed that the matter would be submitted to the AAA for the appointment of an arbitrator meeting the requirements set forth above. The procedures for appointment and the conduct of the arbitration shall be in accordance with the AAA's Commercial Arbitration Rules, except as otherwise provided&nbsp;herein. As noted, for more information about the arbitration process or the AAA, please consult the AAA website at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.adr.org/?_ga=2.116362309.214854769.1561495045-1858826525.1561495045\">adr.org<\/a>&nbsp;or contact the AAA at:<\/p>\n<p>American Arbitration Association - Customer Service Center<br>\n335 Madison Avenue, 10th Floor<br>\nNew York, New York 10017-4605<br>\nPhone: (212) 716-5870<br>\nFax: (212) 716-5907<br>\nPhone Toll-Free: (800) 778-7879<br>\n<a href=\"http://www.adr.org/?_ga=2.116362309.214854769.1561495045-1858826525.1561495045\">AAA Website<\/a><\/p>\n<p><b>We agree that by entering into&nbsp;our Agreement, we are each waiving any right to trial by jury, except to the extent that may be applicable for the Excluded Claims as defined in our Agreement.<\/b>&nbsp;All disputes (other than Excluded Claims) relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable, are for the arbitrator to decide, except those issues relating to the scope, application, and enforceability of the arbitration provision, which are for a court with jurisdiction to decide, if necessary. The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), not state arbitration law, shall govern the arbitrability of our disputes. However, applicable federal law or the law of the state consistent with our Agreement may apply to, and govern the substance of, our disputes. No state statutes pertaining to arbitration shall be applicable under this arbitration provision, except to the extent required by law.\u2028 If there is a conflict between this arbitration provision and the rules of the AAA, this arbitration provision shall govern.<\/p>\n<p>The arbitrator may award relief in favor of only the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. Neither party nor the arbitrator shall be entitled to join or consolidate claims in arbitration by or against the other party, other individuals or entities, or arbitrate any claim as a representative member of a class or in a private attorney general capacity.<\/p>\n<p>For claims of $10,000 or less, the party bringing the claim can choose to&nbsp;have the arbitration carried out so that the arbitrator will base his or her decision solely on documents submitted by the parties, or it may choose to&nbsp;have the arbitration conducted through an in-person or phone call hearing. The parties also may agree to&nbsp;proceed without a hearing for amounts in excess of $10,000. If an in-person hearing is held, the arbitration will take place at a location near the area where you receive our services, unless otherwise agreed. The arbitrator will honor claims of privilege recognized by law and will take reasonable steps to protect the customer's account information and any other confidential or proprietary information.<\/p>\n<p>The Arbitration Award.&nbsp;The arbitrator will make any award in writing but, to reduce the time and expense of the arbitration, the arbitrator will not provide a statement of reasons for his or her award unless requested to do so by both parties. The award of the arbitrator may be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction. An arbitration award and any judgment confirming it apply only to that specific case; it cannot be used in any other case except to enforce the arbitration award itself.<\/p>\n<p>If an award granted by the arbitrator exceeds $100,000, either party can appeal that award to a three-arbitrator panel administered by the AAA by a written notice of appeal filed within thirty (30) days from the date of&nbsp;entry of the written arbitration award. The members of the three-arbitrator panel will be selected according to the rules of the AAA. The AAA will then notify the parties that the award has been appealed and shall impose a prompt appeal schedule. The party challenging the award shall choose whether the appeal shall be based only on documents or by argument in person or by phone. The three-arbitrator panel will issue its decision within ninety (90) days of the date of&nbsp;the appealing party's notice of appeal. The decision of the three-arbitrator panel shall be final and binding, except for any appellate right which exists under law.<\/p>\n<p>Change in Arbitration Provider.&nbsp;If the AAA will not enforce this arbitration provision as written, it cannot serve as the arbitration organization to resolve our dispute. If this situation arises, the parties shall agree on a substitute arbitration organization. If the parties are unable to agree, the parties shall mutually petition a court of appropriate&nbsp;jurisdiction to appoint an arbitration organization that will enforce this arbitration provision as written. If there is a conflict between this arbitration provision and the rest of our Agreement's terms, this arbitration provision shall govern. Waste Management reserves the right to change this arbitration provision from time to time to substitute an alternative arbitration services supplier where Waste Management has determined in good faith that such arbitration services supplier can provide equivalent arbitration services as set forth herein&nbsp;at a lower cost to the parties.<\/p>\n<p><b>Miscellaneous Provisions<br>\n <\/b>Notices to each party will be deemed given when delivered consistent with our Agreement. This agreement to arbitrate shall survive termination of our Agreement. If any clause within this arbitration provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this arbitration provision, and the remainder of this arbitration provision will be given full force and effect. If the class action waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the entire arbitration provision will be unenforceable, and the dispute will be decided by a court. In the event this entire arbitration provision is determined to be illegal or unenforceable for any reason, or if a claim (other than an Excluded Claim as defined in our Agreement) is brought in a dispute that is found by a court to be excluded from the scope of&nbsp;this arbitration provision, we have each agreed to waive, to the fullest extent allowed by law, any trial by jury.<\/p>\n",

As provided in our Agreement, we have agreed that, except for those claims expressly&nbsp;excluded in our Agreement (EXCLUDED CLAIMS), ANY and ALL existing or future controversy or claim between us arising out of or related to our Agreement or any prior agreements between us, whether based in contract, law or equity or alleging any other legal theory, or arising prior to, in connection with, or after the termination of our Agreement or any prior agreements, shall be resolved by mandatory binding arbitration. (We also may mutually agree to arbitrate any Excluded Claims.)<\/p>\n<p>For ease of reference, here is the relevant Agreement language:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>DISPUTE RESOLUTION-ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER. BINDING ARBITRATION:&nbsp;<\/b>Except for those claims expressly&nbsp;excluded below (EXCLUDED CLAIMS), Customer and Company agree that ANY and all existing or future controversy or claim between them arising out of or related to this Agreement or any&nbsp;other agreements between the parties, whether based in contract, law or equity or alleging any other legal theory, or arising prior to, in connection with, or after the termination of this Agreement or any prior agreements, shall be resolved by mandatory binding arbitration (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wm.com/\">www.wm.com<\/a>&nbsp;for details on arbitration procedures).&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li><b>CLASS ACTION WAIVER:<\/b>&nbsp;Customer and Company agree that under no circumstances, whether in arbitration or otherwise, may customer bring any claim against the Company, or allow any claim that the Customer may have against the Company to be asserted, as part of a class action, on a consolidated or representative basis or otherwise aggregated with claims brought by, or on behalf of, any other entity or person, including other customers of the Company.&nbsp;<\/li>\n<li><b>EXCLUDED CLAIMS:<\/b>&nbsp;The following are not subject to mandatory binding arbitration: (A) either party's claims against the other in connection with bodily injury or real property damage and for environmental indemnification; and (B) Company's claims against Customer for collection or payment of Charges, damages (liquidated or otherwise) or any other amounts due or payable to the Company by the Customer under this Agreement or any prior agreements between the parties, but Customer and Company may mutually agree to arbitrate any Excluded Claims.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><b>General Information<br>\n <\/b>The material below provides information and describes the details of the terms and conditions of the agreed upon arbitration process. Waste Management is committed to controlling costs so we can continue to provide you with the best overall value in waste related services. Litigation avoidance and/or streamlined dispute resolution through arbitration will assist&nbsp;in this regard. For this reason and others, including attempting to amicably resolve any disputes with you, our customer, we have incorporated into our Agreement the binding arbitration process set forth below. Before pursuing arbitration, Waste Management hopes that any issue of concern can be resolved through local management and/or your Sales representative on an informal basis. Waste Management also is willing to explore with you mediation, which is another alternative dispute resolution process in which a third person (a mediator) would aid us in jointly resolving our dispute. However, because no binding decision is rendered in mediation, we each must consider the pros and cons of this alternative process. Nothing said in mediation can later be used in the arbitration process, if the dispute is not resolved in mediation.<\/p>\n<p>If we are unable to resolve a matter to your satisfaction, we have agreed upon the binding arbitration process below to resolve any remaining dispute that is&nbsp;subject to arbitration under our Agreement. Arbitration is an alternative dispute resolution process where a neutral third party (an arbitrator) provides a fair hearing and decides a dispute. An arbitrator can make a decision based solely on documents submitted by the parties, can award the same relief as a court, and must honour the terms of our Agreement. Arbitration does not have a judge or a jury - it is an alternative to litigation in a court. Proceeding in arbitration may result in limited discovery and may be subject to limited review by courts. Arbitration is typically faster, and it is less formal than a courtroom proceeding. Legal counsel is not required, but being represented by legal counsel is an option for each of us. Of course, this process could save time and money for both sides. If either party decides that it desires a hearing, including by telephone, the arbitrator would provide the same.<\/p>\n<p><b>How Does Either Party Begin Arbitration?<br>\n <\/b>The party seeking arbitration under this arbitration provision shall first provide written notice to the other party (at the address and as provided in our Agreement), which notice would include a short statement of the dispute, including the relief sought, and the notice would be served at least thirty (30) days prior to the initiation of arbitration. If we are unable to resolve the dispute within thirty (30) days after receipt of the notice, then either party may proceed to&nbsp;file an arbitration claim. The party initiating the arbitration proceeding would open a case with ICDR Canada (The International Centre for Dispute Resolution in Canada).<\/p>\n<p><b>Dispute Resolution and the Arbitration Process&nbsp;<br>\n <\/b>The parties will jointly appoint a single arbitrator who has at least ten (10) years' experience in the active practice of commercial contracts. The expense and the fees for the arbitrator will be shared equally by the parties. If the parties cannot agree on the appointment of a single arbitrator, it is agreed that the matter would be submitted to ICDR Canada for the appointment of an arbitrator meeting the requirements set forth above. The procedures for appointment and the conduct of the arbitration shall be in accordance with ICDR Canada's Canadian Dispute Resolution Procedures, except as otherwise provided&nbsp;herein. As noted, for more information about the arbitration process or ICDR Canada, please consult the ICDR Canada website at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.icdr.org/icdrcanada\">https://www.icdr.org/icdrcanada<\/a>&nbsp;or contact ICDR Canada at Tel.: 1-844-859-0845.<\/p>\n<p><b>We agree that by entering into&nbsp;our Agreement, we are each waiving any right to trial by jury, except to the extent that may be applicable for the Excluded Claims as defined in our Agreement.<\/b>&nbsp;All disputes (other than Excluded Claims) relating to the scope, application, interpretation, applicability, enforceability, alleged breach and appropriate&nbsp;relief for such breach, or formation of this Agreement, including any claim that all or any part of this Agreement is void or voidable, are for the arbitrator to decide. &nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;<i>Arbitration Act, 1991<\/i>&nbsp;(Ontario) (or the arbitration statute of such other province or territory in which the arbitration will be conducted), shall govern the arbitration and the arbitrability of our disputes. If there is a conflict between this arbitration provision and the rules of the ICDR Canada, this arbitration provision shall govern.<\/p>\n<p>The arbitrator may award relief in favour of only the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim. Neither party nor the arbitrator shall be entitled to join or consolidate claims in arbitration by or against the other party, other individuals or entities, or arbitrate any claim as a representative member of a class or in a private attorney general capacity.<\/p>\n<p>For claims of $10,000 or less, the party bringing the claim can choose to&nbsp;have the arbitration carried out so that the arbitrator will base his or her decision solely on documents submitted by the parties, or it may choose to&nbsp;have the arbitration conducted through an in-person or phone call hearing. The parties also may agree to&nbsp;proceed without a hearing for amounts in excess of $10,000. If an in-person hearing is held, the arbitration will take place at a location near the area where you receive our services, unless otherwise agreed. The arbitrator will honour claims of privilege recognized by law and will take reasonable steps to protect the customer's account information and any other confidential or proprietary information.<\/p>\n<p><u>The Arbitration Award<\/u>. The arbitrator will make any award in writing but, to reduce the time and expense of the arbitration, the arbitrator will not provide a statement of reasons for his or her award unless requested to do so by both parties. The award of the arbitrator may be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction. An arbitration award and any judgment confirming it apply only to that specific case; it cannot be used in any other case except to enforce the arbitration award itself.<\/p>\n<p>If an award granted by the arbitrator exceeds $100,000, either party can appeal that award to a court in accordance with applicable law. &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><u>Change in Arbitration Services Supplier<\/u>. If ICDR Canada will not enforce this arbitration provision as written, or ICDR Canada no longer exists, it cannot serve as the arbitration organization to resolve our dispute. If this situation arises, the parties shall agree on a substitute Canadian arbitration organization. If the parties are unable to agree, either party may apply to a court of appropriate&nbsp;jurisdiction to appoint a Canadian arbitration organization, or in lieu of an organization, then an arbitrator, that will enforce this arbitration provision as written. If there is a conflict between this arbitration provision and the rest of our Agreement's terms, this arbitration provision shall govern. We also agree that Waste Management may&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;<\/b>&nbsp;change this arbitration provision from time to time to substitute an alternative Canadian arbitration services supplier where Waste Management has determined in good faith that such arbitration services supplier can provide equivalent arbitration services as set forth herein&nbsp;at a lower cost to the parties.<\/p>\n<p><b>Miscellaneous Provisions<br>\n <\/b>Notices to each party will be deemed given when delivered consistent with our Agreement. This agreement to arbitrate shall survive termination of our Agreement. If any clause within this arbitration provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this arbitration provision, and the remainder of this arbitration provision will be given full force and effect. If the class action waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, the entire arbitration provision will be unenforceable, and the dispute will be decided by a Canadian court of competent jurisdiction. In the event this entire arbitration provision is determined to be illegal or unenforceable for any reason, or if a claim (other than an Excluded Claim as defined in our Agreement) is brought in a dispute that is found by a court to be excluded from the scope of&nbsp;this arbitration provision, we have each agreed to waive, to the fullest extent allowed by law, any trial by jury.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n",

Notifications for rate increases are typically provided the month of, or the month prior to, the increase and can be found in the &quot;important messages&quot; section on a customer's invoice.<\/p>\n<p class=\"make-global\">Increases to service rates may be based on any number of factors, including to cover increases to both internal and third-party disposal, processing and/or transportation costs, increased costs due to uncontrollable circumstances, including, without limitation, changes in local, state or federal laws or regulations, imposition of taxes, fees or surcharges or acts of God such as floods, fires, hurricanes and natural disasters, and increases in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Standard CPI rate increases are tied to increases to the Canadian Property Taxes and Other Special Charges Consumer Price Index (rolling 12-month average) published by Statistics Canada. We may also apply different CPI-based price increases, including a contractually allowed CPI+4% price increase for certain customers, or seek price increases for other reasons and/or to achieve acceptable operating margins.<\/p>\n<p class=\"make-global\"><b><span class=\"first_sentence\">Franchise/Municipal Customers<\/span><\/b><br>\nResidential, commercial and roll-off container customers serviced pursuant to a franchise agreement with a municipality or local governmental authority are subject to price increases permitted under the terms of such agreements.<\/p>\n<p class=\"make-global\"><b><span class=\"first_sentence\">Open Market/Subscription Residential Customers<\/span><\/b><br>\nGenerally, open market residential subscription collection customers are serviced on a prepaid quarter by quarter (or other periodic) basis, without individual service agreements. Therefore, Waste Management of Canada can increase the price or cost to provide such residential collection service from billing period to billing period, and customers may terminate or choose to not renew services after each billing period.&nbsp;Residential subscription customers are billed in advance and invoices represent our offer to provide or continue to provide such services for the specified billing period. By paying the invoice and not canceling service, the customer is agreeing to continue the service for the billing period and there is no proration or partial refund for any cancellation prior to the end of the billing period.<\/p>\n<p class=\"make-global\"><b><span class=\"first_sentence\">Non-franchise Commercial/Roll-off<\/span><\/b><br>\nWaste Management of Canada provides non-franchise commercial small containers and permanent (i.e., recurring service) roll-off container service to customers under fixed-term contracts with renewal options. Under Section 4(b) of our current standard service agreement terms and conditions for a commercial small container and roll-off customers (&quot;standard commercial/roll-off service agreement&quot;), we have the right to increase a customer's service rate and charges for any one or more of the following reasons:<\/p>\n<ul class=\"par4_list \">\n<li>for any changes to, or differences between, the actual equipment and services provided by Waste Management of Canada to the customer and those specified in the Service Summary to the customer's service agreement;<\/li>\n<li>for any change in the composition of the &quot;Waste Materials&quot; (as defined in the service agreement) or if the average weight per yard of the customer's Waste Materials exceeds the amount specified on the customer's Service Summary;<\/li>\n<li>for any increase in or other modification to our Energy Surcharge, Recyclable Material Offset, and/or any Fees/Charges included in the customer's Service Summary;<\/li>\n<li>for any increase in or other modification to our Fuel Surcharge, Environmental Charge, or Regulatory Cost Recovery Charge, for those customers still paying these charges rather than the Energy Surcharge after April 2023;<\/li>\n<li>to cover any increases in disposal, processing and/or transportation costs, including fuel surcharges;<\/li>\n<li>to cover increased costs due to uncontrollable circumstances, including, without limitation, changes in local, provincial, or federal laws or regulations, the imposition of taxes, fees or surcharges or acts of God such as floods, fires, pandemics, hurricanes, and natural disasters; and/or<\/li>\n<li>for increases in any Consumer Price Index (generally the Canadian Property Taxes and Other Special Charges Consumer Price Index published by Statistics Canada).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p class=\"make-global\">The price increases specified in Section 4(b) may be applied singularly or cumulatively and may include an amount for operating or profit margin. Price increases are not represented to be solely an offset or pass-through of the company's costs.<\/p>\n<p class=\"make-global\">In addition to specific price increases allowed under Section 4(b), Waste Management of Canada also regularly seek price increases subject to customer consent pursuant to Section 4(c) of our standard commercial/roll-off service agreement. Waste Management of Canada notifies such customers of these price increases subject to customer consent, through invoice messaging, invoice inserts or separately mailed price increase notifications. Under Section 4(c) of such service agreement, the customer can either accept the price increase or trigger termination of its service agreement, without any obligation to pay liquidated damages. Under Section 4(a) of our standard commercial/roll-off service agreement, payment of the price increase is deemed to be a customer's consent to the consensual price increase.<\/p>\n<p class=\"make-global\">Pricing, price increases and the assessment of charges, whether pursuant to Section 4 of our standard commercial/roll-off service agreement or subject to other applicable service terms or customer consent, are not applied uniformly and vary from customer to customer. By contract or at the company's discretion, some customers are exempt from base rate or CPI-based price increases or do not pay Waste Management's standard or common charges, such as our Energy Surcharge or Fuel and Environmental Charges. Which does not change the aggregate amount of the standard charges charged to all other customers. Section 4 price increases and charges are designed to recover all applicable costs as to all customers from only those customers subject to the price increase or charge, excluding any exempt or non-paying customers, and to achieve an acceptable operating margin.<\/p>\n<p class=\"make-global\"><b><span class=\"first_sentence\">Check Your Applicable Service Terms<\/span><\/b><br>\nThe service terms referenced above may apply to you, or your service terms may be different. Not all collection customers have service agreements and not all commercial and roll-off customers are covered by our standard commercial/roll-off service agreement. Your services may be covered by prior versions of our standard commercial/roll-off service agreement, which have different terms. If you have a service agreement, please check it for your applicable terms.<\/p>\n<p><b>Energy Surcharge<\/b><\/p>\n<p>The Energy Surcharge applies to customers in our collection and disposal lines of business and replaced our former Fuel Surcharge starting with invoices generated during April 2023. The Energy Surcharge is a recurring charge and typically is a fluctuating percentage of all invoice charges, excluding taxes.<\/p>\n<p>The Energy Surcharge is updated monthly and fluctuates up or down based upon changes in the reported prices of diesel fuel and/or natural gas (a component of compressed natural gas or \u201cCNG\u201d), as reported by the Canadian national diesel price index published by Bloomberg and the Henry Hub spot price index for natural gas. The Energy Surcharge is intended to measure the changes in the cost of diesel, natural gas, and other hydrocarbon-based fuels and products that our WM operating companies and subcontractors use in our overall enterprise. Energy or fuel surcharges are common in the waste and transportation industries, such as airlines, trucking and delivery service companies, and in utilities. <b>Learn more about the WM Energy Surcharge for <a title=\"Energy Surcharge for customers in Canada\" href=\"/ca/en/terms/energy-surcharge.html\">customers in Canada<\/a>.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><b>Not a Governmental Tax; Future Changes<\/b><br>\nThe Fuel/Environmental Charge is not a tax or surcharge imposed by or remitted to any governmental or regulatory agency; it is our charge.

Here\u2019s how it works:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>WM Smart Truck® technology captures footage of your containers as we tip them into the truck during service. The software, working with GPS, also notes the service address and helps us mark your pickup complete.<\/li>\n<li>Technicians review the footage to make sure materials were placed in the correct container and collected successfully. This information is never shared.\u202f<\/li>\n<li>We\u2019ll give you a heads up if a container associated with your service address is overloaded or contains non-acceptable material so you can adjust your service levels or usage. Depending on your location and service contract, these notifications may also inform you of warnings or charges.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<hr>\n\n<p>To help your community meet its sustainability goals and avoid overages and contaminations, be sure to take care of your waste the right way:<\/p>\n<h5>Put materials in the correct cart and make sure the lid can fully close.<\/h5>\n<p>Log in to\u202f<a href=\"/us/en/mywm/user/preferences/search.html\" target=\"_blank\">My WM<\/a>\u202fand opt in to \u202fSmart Truck® Insights\u202ffor alerts about incorrectly filled carts.

The Energy Surcharge is a recurring charge and typically is a fluctuating percentage of all invoice charges, excluding taxes.<\/p>\n<p>The Energy Surcharge fluctuates up or down based upon changes in the reported prices of diesel fuel and/or natural gas (a component of compressed natural gas or \u201cCNG\u201d), as reported by the U.S. Department of Energy in its weekly diesel price index and by the Henry Hub spot price index for natural gas. For Canadian customers, the Canadian national diesel price index is published by Bloomberg.<\/p>\n<p>The Energy Surcharge is intended to measure the changes in the cost of diesel, natural gas, and other hydrocarbon-based fuels and products that our WM operating companies and subcontractors use in our overall enterprise.
